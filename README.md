# All-NFI-updater-Docker

A bash script which checks [NostalgiaForInfinity](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity) for newly added tags and updates it for usage with the [Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) bot.  
After updating it rebuilds and reloads the docker container.

His script didn't work with my setup so I customised it myself.
